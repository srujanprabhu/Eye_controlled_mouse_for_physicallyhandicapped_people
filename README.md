There have been many advances in the way we interact with computers over the last few decades. It started with keyboards, then touch displays were introduced for more 
seamless accessibility. However, these technologies have various 
drawbacks, such as being inefficient for people with specific 
physical disabilities. However, there has been significant 
research in the field of a new method for interaction in recent 
times. Particularly, iris movements. Iris movement-based 
Cursor systems is a novel system that enables users to control 
the cursor on a computer screen through the movement of their 
eyes, using computer vision and gaze detection techniques. The 
system is designed to revolutionize computer interaction for 
individuals with physical disabilities, who often face challenges 
with traditional input methods. This research focuses on 
improving the efficiency, reliability, and accuracy of the iris 
movement-based cursor technology. The objective of this study 
is to develop an iris movement-based cursor tracking system 
that provides a touch-free, efficient, and accessible interface for 
computer interaction, thereby improving the user experience 
for people especially for those with physical disabilities. The 
project encompasses key stages, including video processing, 
gaze processing (iris tracking), cursor control, and user 
interaction. The system simulates mouse movement and click 
events based on iris movement and gaze patterns, and provides 
a mechanism for interaction. The system is thoroughly tested 
and optimized to enhance its efficiency and usability, and is 
continually refined based on performance evaluation. Iris 
movement-based cursor stands at the forefront of advancing 
accessibility, promoting universal technology access, and setting 
a trajectory for a more inclusive and empowering future in 
human-computer interaction.
